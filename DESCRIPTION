Description: Estimating mutation and selection coefficients on synonymous
       codon bias usage based on models of Nonsense Errors (NSE).
       The Exchange Algorithm for Markov Chain Monte Carlo on 
       doubly-intractible distributions is used to
       estimate and predict protein production rates without the presence
       of expressions and measurement errors.
